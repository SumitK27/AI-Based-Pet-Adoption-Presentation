                                Only 2% - 17% of pets returns to their owners.
                                Due to lack of space in shelters the rest of the
                                animals are put to rest (killed)

                                The current methods used to adopt or looking for
                                pet is inefficient and haphazard. People
                                distributed flyers to public and spread the news
                                to the people around the area where the pet is
                                lost. When people print out flyers, it results
                                into waste of paper and money as it does not
                                have any positive outcome. People also post
                                stories on social media platforms such as
                                instagram, facebook. There are numerous scammers
                                too who try to falsely claim the reward for
                                returning the pet to their rightful owner.

                            People are turning to adoption apps because they
                            don't have the time to make frequent stops at animal
                            shelters. To find their next companion they need a
                            reliable and intuitive app, but find themselves
                            frustrated with the lack of features and
                            information, leading to no adoption.

                                The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a
                                simple, supervised machine learning algorithm
                                that can be used to solve both classification
                                and regression problems. It's easy to implement
                                and understand, but has a major drawback of
                                becoming significantly slows as the size of that
                                data in use grows.

                                The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a
                                simple, supervised machine learning algorithm

                                and regression problems. It's easy to implement
                                and understand, but has a major drawback of
                                becoming significantly slows as the size of that
                                data in use grows.
