                            entering animal shelters nationwide every year,
                            approximately 2.7 million are euthanized. The number
                            of euthanized animals could be reduced dramatically
                            if more people adopted pets instead of buying them.

                            around the area where the pet is lost. When people
                            print out flyers, it results into waste of paper and
                            money as it does not have any positive outcome.
                            People also post stories on social media platforms
                            such as instagram, facebook. There are numerous

                            returning the pet to their rightful owner.

                                        In recent years, the pace of people's
                                        life has accelerated, resulting in an
                                        increase in the number of abandoned
                                        pets. More and more displaced animals
                                        have not only affected the animals of
                                        nature, but also the lives of human
                                        beings. The adoption of animals raises
                                        the awareness of people to care for
                                        animals, thus reducing the occurrence of
                                        unscrupulous pet owners. Pet adoption
                                        can also help children develop an
                                        awareness of protecting animals and
                                        nature.

                                different methods of animal identification
                                focusing on radio frequency identification and
                                how it works. RFID tags transmit animal
                                identification information using radio waves. It
                                is one of the three pillars of trace ability,
                                along with premises identification and movement,
                                and is increasingly important in livestock
                                management.

                            The prototype of our Pet Adoption Application was
                            developed successfully. The major objectives covered
                            by our application are as follows:-
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">
                                People will come to know about stray animals
                                that need their help around their vicinity.
                            </li>
                            <li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">
                                The number of stray animals euthanized will be
                                reduced.
                            </li>

                                Kind hearted people will get an opportunity to
                                do something for helpless animals.

                                so.
