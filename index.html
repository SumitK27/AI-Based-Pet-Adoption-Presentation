                                The current methods used to adopt or looking for
                                pet is inefficient and haphazard. People
                                distributed flyers to public and spread the news
                                to the people around the area where the pet is
                                lost. When people print out flyers, it results
                                into waste of paper and money as it does not
                                have any positive outcome. People also post
                                stories on social media platforms such as
                                instagram, facebook. There are numerous scammers
                                too who try to falsely claim the reward for
                                returning the pet to their rightful owner.

                                The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a
                                simple, supervised machine learning algorithm
                                that can be used to solve both classification
                                and regression problems. It's easy to implement
                                and understand, but has a major drawback of
                                becoming significantly slows as the size of that
                                data in use grows.

                                The A9 Algorithm is the system which Amazon uses
                                to decide how products are ranked in search
                                results. It is similar to the algorithm which
                                Google uses for its search results, in that it
                                considers keywords in deciding which results are
                                most relevant to the search and therefore which
                                it will display first.

                                Apparently, it's trying to find out fake
                                profiles and address the major problem of
